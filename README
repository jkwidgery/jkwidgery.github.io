Untitled Square Game was my second-semester game project at DigiPen Institute of Technology. 
Team size: 5
High Concept: Fast-paced endless climber party game with support for multiplayer (up to 4)!
Total Line Count: 1551.23

My Tasks:
Write behavior code for moving tiles, bouncy tiles, and fluid tiles
Handle input (was not responsible for controller support)
UI (menus and credits)
Designed some levels

Disclaimer: Only some of my code is present here. I worked on much more on this team, but I'm unable to post files that my other teammates contributed to.
