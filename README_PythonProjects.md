The files contained within this branch showcase my work in Python. Some of these files are dependent on input that I have chosen not to upload here-- if you would like to run these programs, please contact me for the data!

The code here includes but is not limited to:
- Exploratoring Python and Data Analysis
- A spam filter built on the Naive Baye's algorithm which trains on input data, then can accurately identify if an email is spam or not.
- Applications of Linear and Logistic Regression
- A visualization of the k-means clustering algorithm that recolors input photos
- A neural network that can identify handwritten digits (cowritten with Braedan Nevers)
