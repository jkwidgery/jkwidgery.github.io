# Return to the Skywway

Return to the Skyway was my sophomore year game project at DigiPen Institute of Technology. Most of my work was contributed to building the custom engine the game was built on.
High Concept: Traverse through a fantastical island and utilize the local fauna to destroy obstacles. In this 2D platform, the player controls a character that has crash landed on a tropical island. The player must complete puzzles utilizing the creatures' unique abilities in order to fix their ship and return to the Skyway!

Team size: 13 (7 developers, 2 game designers, 3 artists, 1 sound designer)

My Role:
Design and implement a clean, intuitive designer pipeline by building the engine editor using ImGUI and RTTR libraries
